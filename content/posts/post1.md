In this post I describe a problem I ran into the other day that had me stumped brieflyâ€”why doesn't my ASP.NET Core app running in Docker respond when I try and navigate to it? The problem was related to how ASP.NET Core binds to ports by default.

## Background: testing ASP.NET Core on CentOS[](#background-testing-asp-net-core-on-centos)

I ran into my problem the other day while responding to an issue report related to CentOS. In order to diagnose the issue, I needed to run an ASP.NET Core application on CentOS. Unfortunately, [while ASP.NET Core supports CentOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-centos), they don't provide Docker images with it preinstalled. Currently, they provide Linux Docker images based on:

- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Alpine

Additionally, while you *can* [install CentOS in WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/use-custom-distro), it's a lot more hassle than something like Ubuntu, which you can install directly from the Microsoft Store.

This left me with one obvious answer - build my own CentOS Docker image, and install ASP.NET Core in it "manually".

### Creating the sample app with a Dockerfile.[](#creating-the-sample-app-with-a-dockerfile-)

I started by creating a sample web application using Visual Studio. I could have used the CLI to create the app, but I decided to use Visual Studio as I knew it would give me the option to auto-generate the Dockerfile as well. This would save a few minutes.

I chose ASP.NET Core Web API, used minimal APIs, disabled https, enabled Docker support (Linux) and generated the solution:

<img width="780" height="548" src=":/3235bbecd009427cbdf0a870ec1d882c" class="jop-noMdConv">

This generates a Debian-based dockerfile by default (the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnetcore:6.0` images are Debian based unless you select different tags), which looks like this:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["WebApplication1.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore "./WebApplication1.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "WebApplication1.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "WebApplication1.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebApplication1.dll"] 
```

This Dockerfile uses the best practice of multi-staged builds to ensure your runtime images are as small as possible. It shows 4 distinct phases

- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnetcore:6.0 AS base`. This stage defines the base image that will be used to *run* your application. It contains the *minimal* dependencies to run your application.
- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build`. This stage defines the docker image that will be used to *build* your application. It includes the full .NET SDK, as well as [various other dependencies](https://andrewlock.net/exploring-the-net-core-mcr-docker-files-runtime-vs-aspnet-vs-sdk/#4-mcr-microsoft-com-dotnet-core-sdk-2-2-105). This stage actually builds your application.
- `FROM build AS publish`. This stage is used to *publish* your application.
- `base AS final`. The final stage is what you would actually deploy to production. It is based on the `base` image, but with the `publish` assets copied in.

> Multi-stage builds are always best-practice when you're deploying to Docker, but this one is more complex than it needs to be in general. It has additional stages to make it quicker for Visual Studio to **develop** inside Docker images too, [using "fast mode"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/container-build?view=vs-2022). If you're only *deploying* to Docker, not developing in Docker, then you can simplify this file.

### Creating a CentOS-based ASP.NET Core image[](#creating-a-centos-based-asp-net-core-image)

For my testing, I only needed to *run* the application on CentOS, I didn't need to *build* on CentOS, so that meant I could leave the `build` stage as it was, building on Debian. It was only the first stage, `base`, that I would need to switch to a CentOS-based image.

I started by finding [the instructions for how to install ASP.NET Core on CentOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-centos). Each Linux distro is a little bit different, with some versions using package managers, others using Snap packages etc. For CentOS we can use the [`yum` package manager](http://yum.baseurl.org/).

Installing ASP.NET Core is thankfully, very simple. You need only to add the Microsoft package repository and install using YUM. Starting from the CentOS version 7 Docker image, we can build out ASP.NET Core Docker image:

```
FROM centos:7 AS base

# Add Microsoft package repository and install ASP.NET Core
RUN rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm \
    && yum install -y aspnetcore-runtime-6.0

WORKDIR /app

# ... remainder of dockerfile as before 
```

With that change to the `base` image, we can now build and run our sample ASP.NET Core app on CentOS using a command like the following:

```
docker build -t centos-test .
docker run --rm -p 8000:5000 centos-test 
```

Which, when you run it and navigate to http://localhost:8000/weatherforecast, looks something like this:

<img width="780" height="408" src=":/5c24f29a7b964eb6947b952b58b0371f" class="jop-noMdConv">

Oh dear.

## Debugging why the app isn't responding[](#debugging-why-the-app-isn-t-responding)

I hadn't expected that result. I thought that it would be a simple case of installing ASP.NET Core, and the app would just work. My first thought was that I had introduced a bug somewhere that was causing the app to fail to start, but the logs printed to the console suggested the app was listening:

```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /app/ 
```

Additionally, I could see that the app was also listening on the *correct* port, port 5000. In my Docker command I specified that Docker should map port `5000` *inside* the container to port `8000` *outside* the container, so that also looked correct.

> I double checked [the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#expose-incoming-ports) at this point, to make sure I had the `8000:5000` the correct way around, and yes, the format is `host:container`

This all seemed rather odd. *Presumably*, the application wasn't receiving the request at all, but just to be sure, I bumped up the logging to `Debug` level and tried again:

```
docker run --rm -p 8000:5000 `
    -e Logging__Loglevel__Default=Debug `
    -e Logging__Loglevel__Microsoft.AspNetCore=Debug `
    centos-test 
```

Sure enough, the logs were more verbose, but there was no indication of a request making it through

```
dbug: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host[1]
      Hosting starting
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel[0]
      Unable to bind to http://localhost:5000 on the IPv6 loopback interface: 'Cannot assign requested address'.
dbug: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServer[1]
      Unable to locate an appropriate development https certificate.
dbug: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel[0]
      No listening endpoints were configured. Binding to http://localhost:5000 by default.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
dbug: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[13]
      Loaded hosting startup assembly WebApplication1
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /app/
dbug: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host[2]
      Hosting started 
```

So at this point I had two possible scenarios

- The app isn't working at all
- The app isn't correctly exposed outside of the container

To test the first case I decided to `exec` into the container and `curl` the endpoint while it was running. This would tell me whether the app was running correctly inside the container, at the port I expected. I could have used the cli to do this using `docker exec ...`, but for simplicity [I used Docker Desktop to open a command prompt inside the container](https://andrewlock.net/installing-docker-desktop-for-windows/), and to `curl` the endpoint:

<img width="780" height="161" src=":/09fee7fa2227444e9245c5626f803115" class="jop-noMdConv">

Sure enough, `curl`-ing the endpoint inside the container (using the *container* port, `5000`) returned the data I expected. So the app was working *and* it was responding on the correct port. That narrowed down the possible failures modes.

At this point I was running out of options. Luckily, a word in the application logs suddenly caught my eye and pointed me in the right direction. **Loopback**.

## ASP.NET Core URLs: loopback vs. IP Address[](#asp-net-core-urls-loopback-vs-ip-address)

One of the most popular posts on my blog (two years after I wrote it) is ["5 ways to set the URLs for an ASP.NET Core app"](https://andrewlock.net/5-ways-to-set-the-urls-for-an-aspnetcore-app/). In that post I describe some of the ways you can control which URL ASP.NET Core binds to on startup, but the relevant section right now is titled["What URLs can you use?"](https://andrewlock.net/5-ways-to-set-the-urls-for-an-aspnetcore-app/#what-urls-can-you-use-). This section mentions that there are essentially 3 types of URLs that you can bind:

- The "loopback" hostname for IPv4 and IPv6 (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`), in the format: `{scheme}://{loopbackAddress}:{port}`
- A specific IP address available on your machine (e.g. `http://192.168.8.31:5005`), in the format `{scheme}://{IPAddress}:{port}`
- "Any" IP address for a given port (e.g. `http://*:6264`), in the format `{scheme}://*:{port}`

The "loopback" address is the network address that refers to "the current machine". So if you access `http://localhost:5000`, you're trying to access port `5000` on the current machine. This is typically what you want when you're developing, and this is the default URL that ASP.NET Core apps bind to. So when you run an ASP.NET Core app locally, and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser, everything works, because everything is all coming from the same network interface, on the same machine.

However, when you're inside a Docker container *requests aren't coming from the same network interface*. Essentially, you can think of the Docker container as a separate machine. Binding to `localhost` inside the Docker container will mean your app is never exposed outside of the container, rendering it rather useless.

The way to fix this is to ensure your app binds to *any* IP Address, using the `{scheme}://*:{port}` syntax.

> As noted [in my previous post](https://andrewlock.net/5-ways-to-set-the-urls-for-an-aspnetcore-app/#what-urls-can-you-use-), you don't have to use `*` in this pattern, you can use anything that's not an IP address or `localhost`, so you can use `http://*:5000`, `http://+:5000`, or `http://example.com:5000` etc. All of these behave identically.

By binding the ASP.NET Core application to *any* IP address, the request "makes it through" from the host, so it can be handled by your app. We can set the URL at runtime when we run the Docker image, using for example

```
docker run --rm -p 8000:5000 ` -e DOTNET_URLS=http://+:5000 centos-test 
```

or we could bake it into the Dockerfile as shown below. The following is the complete final Dockerfile I used:

```
FROM centos:7 AS base

# Add Microsoft package repository and install ASP.NET Core
RUN rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm \
    && yum install -y aspnetcore-runtime-6.0

# Ensure we listen on any IP Address 
ENV DOTNET_URLS=http://+:5000

WORKDIR /app

# ... remainder of dockerfile as before
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["WebApplication1.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore "./WebApplication1.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "WebApplication1.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "WebApplication1.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebApplication1.dll"] 
```

With this change we can re-build the Docker image, and run the app again with

```
docker build -t centos-test .
docker run --rm -p 8000:5000 centos-test 
```

and finally, we can call the endpoint from our browser:

<img width="780" height="408" src=":/8a4f80d2378f4711aa4b0b81c2d09da6" class="jop-noMdConv">

So the important take away here is:

> When you build your own ASP.NET Core Docker images, make sure to configure the app to bind to any IP address, not just `localhost`.

Of course, the official .NET Docker Images [do that already](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/dcc508d238cd221147038362760c453134085c36/src/runtime-deps/6.0/cbl-mariner1.0/amd64/Dockerfile#L26), binding to port 80 by setting `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80`.

## Summary[](#summary)

In this post I described a situation in which I was trying to build a CentOS Docker image to run ASP.NET Core. I described how I created the image by following the ASP.NET Core installation instructions, but that my ASP.NET Core app wasn't responding to requests. I walked through my debugging process to try to get to the root cause of the problem, and realised that I was binding to the loopback address. This meant the application was accessible from *inside* the Docker container, but not from outside it. To resolve the issue, I made sure to bind my ASP.NET Core app to any IP address, not just `localhost`.
